## Data and Viz of Interest

*Journal or newspaper article that relates data science to a humanities topic that I am interested in.*

1. [Growing Up in Technological Worlds: How Modern Technologies Shape the Everyday Lives of Young People](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/0270467603260812)

The understanding of how technology is shaping the new generation of humans is interesting to learn about because people are now open to discover new expereinces through technology, which can provide a helpful insight for people to learn more about a topic they are interested in. However, technology is also leading people to rely on their devices, such as phones or laptops, to spend most of their time on social media. This could mislead people to a false understanding of reality and distort their social skills as well. 

*Data visualization that I would love to know how to make with Python*

2. Airbnb-GeospatialPlot:

This visualization shows the number range of airbnb listings in certain regions of Singapore. This is interesting to take a look at because it shows what areas could have more airbnb listings, which could provide an insight into the demand of tourism in a ceratain region of Singapore. 


## Ideas for data to investigate

*Three humanities topics of interest to me.*


* Social media and mental health 
* Social Policies and reactions of people
* Ethical issues in media advertising

*Topic that appeals most to me in DH140*

The topic that appeals most to me is data visualization, especailly learning more about the python packages pandas and numpy. These topics seem to be interesting because of the concepts that can be learned and applied to create different visualizations for various data sets I could be interested in the future. 


*SearchED data and/or articles related to the topics from #1 and #2, and wrote down a list of links to my search results.*

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Social Media and Mental Health](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm)
* [Data Visualization](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-visualization)


## Ideas from curated datasets & project lists

*Made a table in the cell below that includes columns for (1) the name of any dataset of my interest, (2) a brief description of the data and how I might investigate it in a project, and (3) a link to the data.*

| Name | Description | Link |
| ---- | :----------- | :--- |
| Health News in Twitter | This dataset contains health news from more than 15 major health news agencies. Data can be used to see if there were any ethical issues in the spread of major health news and if they were right or wrong. | [health news data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Health+News+in+Twitter#) |
|Real Time Election Results: Portugal 2019 | Dataset of the 2019 Portuguese Parlimentary Election results in real time. This can be tied with a dataset of Portugal's News sources posts on social media platforms to see how people's voting changed when posting real time statistics of the elections. | [Portugal Election Results 2019 Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real-time+Election+Results%3A+Portugal+2019)|
